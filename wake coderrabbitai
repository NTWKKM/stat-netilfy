Wake up, Rabbit! Knock, knock! I say,
A fresh new patch is coming your way.
Morning has broken, the sun is bright,
I’ve fixed the code through the long, dark night.

Grab some snacks or carrots 🥕, sweet and crunch,
Or maybe a leafy treat for your brunch?
Pick what you prefer, fuel up your mind,
And leave no buggy logic behind.

You’ve worked so hard to guard the repo,
Checking the status, making it flow.
But now that the review is deep and clear,
Please take a nap, right safely here.

No more alerts, no errors to fear,
Just close your eyes, sweet Rabbit dear.
zzZZZ...
